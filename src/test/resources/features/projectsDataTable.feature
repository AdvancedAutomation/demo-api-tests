Feature: Projects

  Scenario: PUT Project
    Given I send a "POST" request to "/projects" with data table
      | name             | Project created by cucumber |
      | public           | true                        |
      | week_start_day   | Tuesday                     |
      | iteration_length | 2                           |
    And I save the response as "P"
    When I send a "PUT" request to "/projects/{P.id}" with json body
    """
    {
    "name": "Project updated by cucumber"
    }
    """
    Then I validate the response has status code 200
    And I validate the response contains "name" equals "Project updated by cucumber"
    And I send a "DELETE" request to "/projects/{P.id}"
    And I validate the response has status code 204
